= Deploy JBoss EAP Application with S2I
include::_attributes.adoc[]

[#overview]
== Overview

https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[Source-to-Image (S2I)] is a framework that makes it easy to build images starting from your source code. In reality S2I can start from your source code, a file (usually a binary), a bunch of files or a Dockerfile.

Here we're going to concentrate on the first strategy, building our application image starting from the code in a git repository.

TIP: The *main advantages* of using S2I for building images are the *ease of use* for developers and being a *repeatable process*.

[#but-how-does-it-work]
=== But How Does It Work?

Well as you can see in the previous image building an image that runs your code comprises three phases:

- *Build App:* Compiling code, this is language specific and can imply downloading dependencies, compiling, linking, etc. All the tools needed should be present at the builder image. The output of this phase is a binary file or a jar, along with libraries if necessary, etc.
- *Build Image:* In this phase we put the output of the previous phase in a known location inside the image so that it can be run later as a container. The output of this phase is an image based on the builder image or a specific image with the minimum required components for running and your application.
- *Deploy:* Finally we need to deploy our image to a kubernetes cluster and this means referring to our application image from a *Deployment*, *DeploymentConfig*, *StatefulSet*, *DaemonSet*, *Job*, etc.

Let's go a bit deeper with the explanation, in order to build your application you will need a builder image designed according to the S2I framework. In general, you will use a supported image by Red Hat, it can be for Java, Python, .Net, etc. go link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/openshift_images/using_images/using-s21-images.html[here] but if you need or want to create your own builder image you can go link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/images/creating-images#images-create-s2i-scripts_create-images[here] to learn all you need to do it.

In a nutshell a builder image is an image that includes:

- *All the tools you need to compile*, download dependencies, etc. for a given programming language.
- *Source-to-image scripts:* You can write source-to-image (S2I) scripts in any programming language, as long as the scripts are executable inside the builder image. S2I supports multiple options providing `assemble/run/save-artifacts` scripts.

The two more important scripts are `assemble` and `run`:

- *`assemble`* -> The assemble script builds the application artifacts from a source and places them into appropriate directories inside the image. This script is required.
- *`run`* ->  The run script executes your application. This script is required.

[#being-more-specific]
=== Being More Specific

Ok, for now the explanation applies to any language/framework, but this lab has to do with a specific language, Java, and a specific runtime to deploy it on, JBoss EAP, so let's go a bit deeper.

First, *you will be using a specific builder image* for JBoss EAP instead of the plain Java builder image. Specifically in this lab you will use this image:

[attributes]
====
*`registry.redhat.io/jboss-eap-7/eap72-openshift:latest`*
====

Second, the `assemble` and `run` scripts are crafted to help you avoiding substituting the `standalone.xml` file that comes with the image. Don't take this wrong, you still can substitute it but it's usually a better practice to adapt the file during the `assemble` and `run` stages using well defined procedures, this there are more chances that you will build the image for application across minor upgrades of JBoss EAP without making any changes to the configuration of S2I. 

You can find more information about building images for JBoss EAP using S2I link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.4/html/getting_started_with_jboss_eap_for_openshift_container_platform/configuring_eap_openshift_image[here].

[#getting-started]
== Let's get started

Everything we do in this section requires that you have fulfilled the xref:01-setup.adoc#prerequisite[prerequisites] section and you're logged in your OpenShift cluster.

[WARNING]
====
Log in *as normal user*, [.underline]#not as a cluster admin#.
====

So if not already logged in, please do it now.

[CAUTION]
====
If you're using `DevSpaces` or the `web-terminal`, you don't need to log in, you're already logged in, try this command `oc whoami` and check that the response is: {username}.

[#deploy]
== Deploying a JBOSS EAP 7.2 application manually

Let's deploy the Kitchensink App!

[IMPORTANT]
====
This template deploys our application using a `DeploymentConfig` instead of the kubernetes `Deployment` object, starting in chapter `ArgoCD + Helm` you will see that we've moved from `DeploymentConfig` to `Deployment`.

#TODO#
====

. First of all, create the project that will host the application:
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc new-project s2i-{username}
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Please open the next link to watch the progress of the chapter. 

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{openshift-console-host}/topology/ns/s2i-{username}?view=graph
----
====
+
. Deploy the PostgreSQL database for the kitchensink app:
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc new-app --name=kitchensink-db \
 -e POSTGRESQL_USER=luke \
 -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=secret \
 -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=kitchensink centos/postgresql-10-centos7 \
 --as-deployment-config=false

oc label deployment/kitchensink-db app.kubernetes.io/part-of=kitchensink-app --overwrite=true && \
oc label deployment/kitchensink-db app.openshift.io/runtime=postgresql --overwrite=true
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The ``oc label`` commands adds decoration to our deployment (used for the #Topology view#):

- ``app.openshift.io/runtime``: Icon displayed in the node
- ``app.kubernetes.io/part-of``: App grouping
====
+
. Deploy the kitchensink app:
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc new-app --template=eap72-basic-s2i \
-p APPLICATION_NAME=kitchensink \
-p MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND="-Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.jbossorg" \
-p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL="https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink" \
-p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF=main \
-p CONTEXT_DIR=.
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In order to deploy the Kitchensink app, we use a template, ``eap72-basic-s2i``.

A template describes a set of objects that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects for creation by OpenShift Container Platform. A template can be processed to create anything you have permission to create within a project, for example services, build configurations, and deployment configurations. A template can also define a set of labels to apply to every object defined in the template.

You can create a list of objects from a template using the CLI or, if a template has been uploaded to your project or the global template library, using the web console.
====
+
. Adjust the context of the application and add _decoration_ (labels and annotation):
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc set env dc/kitchensink DB_HOST=kitchensink-db DB_PORT=5432 DB_NAME=kitchensink DB_USERNAME=luke DB_PASSWORD=secret && \
oc set probe dc/kitchensink --readiness --initial-delay-seconds=90 --failure-threshold=5 && \
oc set probe dc/kitchensink --liveness --initial-delay-seconds=90 --failure-threshold=5

oc label dc/kitchensink app.kubernetes.io/part-of=kitchensink-app --overwrite=true && \
oc label dc/kitchensink app.openshift.io/runtime=jboss --overwrite=true

oc annotate dc/kitchensink \
 app.openshift.io/connects-to='[{"apiVersion":"apps/v1","kind":"Deployment","name":"kitchensink-db"}]' \
 --overwrite=true
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The ``app.openshift.io/connects-to`` annotation is used to connect the nodes.

Eventually you will see a trace like this => `>>>>>>> Running install.sh <<<<<<`. This is a sign that the S2I building process has detected our script to prepare the image as desired.

image::s2i-02.png[Build Log]

#Explain this better and according to the explanations given before in this chapter#

After the building process has finished the image is pushed and the `DeploymentConfig` object is updated accordingly to use the new image. If you go the `Topology` view you should see this.

image::s2i-04.png[Deployed]

Time to check if our application works as expected. Please click on the route icon.

[#redeploy]
== Redeploying a JBOSS EAP application

[CAUTION]
====
You have to wait until the application has been deployed, in the previous item, in order to redeploy it!


====

Let's explore a quick way to test _minor_ changes in our application. In this case you will package your JBoss EAP application locally and later you will use ``oc cp`` to copy the WAR file directly to the deployment folder of JBoss EAP already running in OCP.

[CAUTION]
====
Use this way of deployment only in a #development environment#, #*NEVER* in productive environments#.
====

Let's make a change in our application, open file `$TUTORIAL_HOME/src/main/webapp/index.xhtml` (the Kitchensink code repo) and go to line 27 approx. and make a change. For instance change this:

[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
<div>
    <p>You have successfully deployed the JBoss Application in OpenShift</p>
</div>
----

With:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
<div>
    <p>You have successfully deployed the JBoss Application in OpenShift !!!</p>
</div
----

Then please, run these commands:

[NOTE]
====
`oc cp` command doesn't show a progress bar and usually is quite fast, if there are no errors no messages will be surfaced, just proceed with the tests.
====

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc project s2i-{username}

POD_NAME=$(oc get pod -l application=kitchensink -o json | jq -r .items[0].metadata.name)
echo "POD_NAME=${POD_NAME}"

mvn package -Popenshift

oc cp ./target/ROOT.war ${POD_NAME}:/deployments/ROOT.war
----

Open this link to check if the change is already applied.

[CAUTION]
====
Take into account that for a short period of time the app is being replaced and you could get a 404 error if you're quick enough.
