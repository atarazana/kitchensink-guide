= Prepare Cluster
include::_attributes.adoc[]

This section is devoted to prepare the OpenShift cluster, hence something to be done before actually run the proper GitOps lab.

Everything we do in this section requires that you have fulfilled the xref:02-setup.adoc#prerequisite[prerequisites] section, that you're logged in your OpenShift cluster and you have `cluster-admin` permissions on it.

If you don't have an OpenShift cluster and/or you don't have `cluster-admin` permissions on it you could for instance using https://try.openshift.com[try.openshift.com].	

[CAUTION]
====
*Run this section only if you're preparing the lab environment* and as a `cluster-admin` user. If you just want to run the lab then proceed to the  xref:02-setup.adoc[next section].
====

So if you are not already logged in, please do it now.

[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u {username} -p {password} --server=https://api.{api-domain} --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----

[WARNING]
====
If the API server you're trying to log in uses a self-signed certificate or otherwise non trusted CA you will receive this message

[.console-output]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): 
----

Type 'y' only if you trust the server!

[#deploying-core-components]
== Deploying core components

In order to run this guide we're going to need several components, more prominently:

- *ArgoCD*, the GitOps engine supported by Red Hat through the *OpenShift GitOps operator*
- *Tekton*, the _de facto_ kubernetes native CICD pipelines system supported by Red Hat through the *OpenShift Pipelines operator*
- **OPTIONAL: Quay*, Red Hat's container registry (you can use the SaaS service instead a local instance)

Let's install all of them:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git clone https://{github-kitchen-src} && cd kitchensink
until oc apply -k util/bootstrap/; do sleep 2; done
----

This command execute `oc apply -k ...` until it's done every 2 seconds... this is so because behind scenes some tasks are run asynchronously and in the meantime some errors will be seen as in the next example. The number of errors decreases as components are installed until there are no errors.

[#high-level-tests]
== High level tests

Let's open the OpenShift Web Console and run some validation tests.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{openshift-console-host}
----

You should see something like.

NOTE: You can skip the tour or run it if you want and have time.

Now, take a look to the next picture, there are two arrows pointing to:

- The ArgoCD web console link
- The Pipelines section

image::argocd-pipelines-test-1.png[High level tests 1]

You can see both then we're on the good way.

Open the ArgoCD web console then click on the "LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT" button on the upper right corner and use your credentials:

NOTE: The first time you successfully log in you'll see an Authorize Access request, leave it "as is"  and click on the button that says "Allow selected permissions"

image::argocd-login.png[ArgoCD Log In]

Finally if all went well you should land in the ArgoCD console and see this.

[#checking-quay]
== Checking Quay

First of, open the OpenShift console and go to the topology view of namespace `{quay-namespace}`, use the following link. 

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{openshift-console-host}/k8s/cluster/projects/quay-system/workloads?view=graph
----

You should see something similar to this:

image::quay-installed-topology.png[Quay Topology]

Please open Quay Console in another tab or browser window.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{quay-server}
----

You should see something like this:

[#checking-gitea]
== Checking Gitea

NOTE: Gitea will be installed in `{gitea-namespace}` namespace

include::partial$gitea-tests.adoc[]

While Gitea is being installed a `Job` will in it's turn create some users in Gitea.

Let's wait until the job is complete or times out after 120s with the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc wait --for=condition=complete --timeout=120s job/gitea-setup -n {gitea-namespace}
----

Copy the next url and open it in a new tab, please use these credentials:

- *USERNAME:* user1
- *PASSWORD:* {static-password}

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{gitea-host}/user/login
