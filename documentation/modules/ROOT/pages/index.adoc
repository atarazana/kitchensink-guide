== Deploying JBoss EAP applications on OpenShift

A guide to the different existing methods for deploying a JBoss EAP application on OpenShift.

Benefits of deploying JBoss EAP applications on OpenShift:

* We deploy an immutable container image

** What we test in DEV and PRE environments is deployed in production.
** Reducing risk and simplifying deployment.

* The image building process with ``S2I`` allows the customization of the default standalone file in a simple way and without the need to replace it.

* Image building and deployment is an easily automated process as we will see later.
