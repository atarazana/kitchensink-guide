= Deploy JBoss EAP Application with ArgoCD

[#overview]
== Simplification, git-based automation

We have deployed Kitchensink manually using *S2I*, but...

* How repeatable is this procedure? 
* Is it auditable? Who triggered it? Change it?
* Simple at first, but what about in the long run?

*No worries GitOps to the rescue !!!*

.What is GitOps ?
image::gitops.png[] 

GitOps provides infrastructure as code by using git repositories as the only source of truth that defines de desired cluster state, but GitOps is just an idea, a concept. So in order to use this idea you need an implementation. Red Hat contributes heavily on an community project called link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[Argo CD].

Argo CD can extract the cluster state in a number of ways, directly as files from a folder or by using a plugin.

[#git-repositories-involved]
== Git Repositories Involved

If you remember at the beginning of this guide you migrated a couple of repositories, one was for code, *kitchensink*, the other was for configuration, *kitchensink-conf*.

In this lab you will experience different ways of deploying the application you already know *Kitchesink* in increasing complexity. We have structure the descriptors in *kitchesink-conf* so that these different ways of deployment using Argo CD and live in the same repository.

There are four main directories, namely:

* *basic/base:* here you can find plain yaml descriptors
+
=> In this case #*No plugin* is needed#
* *kustomized/**: here you will find two subdirectories (*_dev and test_*) which are *_overlays or environments_* which relies in a kustomization.yaml file at *basic*
+
=> For this case you will rely on the #*kustomize* plugin#
* *advanced/helm_base:* at this location you can find a helm chart
+
=> here, the #*helm* plugin is needed#
* *advanced/overlays/*:* as in kustomize/* here you will find *_dev and test overlays_* but this time overlays look for resources in *advanced/helm_base* and, as already explained, those resources will be in the shape of a helm chart.
+
=> This case is special, it relies both on helm and kustomized so a #*custom plugin* will be needed#

[#application-keystone-of-argocd]
== `Application` object: Keystone of Argo CD

The `Application` CRD is the Kubernetes resource object representing an Argo CD application instance to be deployed in a certain *destination* given a certain *source* git repository coordinates where Argo CD will be able to get or extract the kubernetes descriptors needed to deploy our application.

TIP: Picture yourself scanning a QR code to download the instructions to mount a piece of furniture from IKEA.

== Deploy Kitchensink with ArgoCD

You're going to deploy again Kitchensink, in pretty much the same way you did before, that is using S2I. But instead of doing it manually Argo CD is going to do it for you.

In order to do so *we have done some pre-work*, *basically we have extracted the descriptors* you have just generated *in project `s2i-{username}` and put them in your git repository*. Please have a look at them using the next link:

[.console-input]
[source,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink-conf/src/branch/main/basic/base
----

There you will find, among others:

- *kitchensink-dc.yaml* => deployment descriptor of kitchensink
- *kitchensink-db-deployment.yaml* => deployment descriptor of the kitchensink database
- *kitchensink-bc.yaml* => `BuildConfig` in charge of building our application image using S2I

Also you will find `Services` a `Route` and an `ImageStream`.

It's time to create the `Application` object with the instruction to deploy our application, please run this command:

[.console-input]

----
<1> Destination namespace
<2> Destination cluster
<3> Source repository and path
<4> Ignore differences is a convenient way of telling ArgoCD not to take into account changes in a given path for certain objects. In this case because OpenShift by default changes the image string by one pointing to the hash not the tag hence generating a loop between OpenShift and ArgoCD.

Open the next link to see how the Application object you just created is seen in ArgoCD UI.

Click on the `LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT` button and use the credentials you've used before:

image::argocd-login.png[Login]

[INFO]
====
If credentials are required use these:

- *USERNAME:* {username}
- *PASSWORD:* {password}
====

After logging in successfully and agreed to `Allow selected permissions` you will land in the `Applications` area and see the application you've just created.

To see the progress of deployment you should go to namespace `argo-{username}` in the OpenShift web console or just copy the following link.
