[#overview]
== Overview

In the chapter devoted to xref:08-helm.adoc#the-catch[helm] we discussed the possibility of using helm to generate the base descriptors for kustomize instead of using static descriptors. Well, this is what you're going to do here.

Let's recap here the key points of what we want to achieve:

* #Git# is the #source of truth#
* We want to deploy on #different platforms *and* different environments#

:fn-custom-plugin: footnote:custom-plugin[How it is defined is out of the scope of this lab but if you want to know more you can have a look link:https://github.com/atarazana/kitchensink/blob/09a9fd1ee642b7cda17d4a2e63ee11c5d1a61cc6/util/bootstrap/3.adapt-operators/gitops-patch.yaml#L35[here^] and link:https://argocd-vault-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/#custom-image-and-configuration-via-sidecar[here^]]

To accomplish this, we need to use `helm` and `kustomize` together. This is possible because Argo CD plugin framework allows to define custom plugins. In this exercise you will use one custom plugin called `kustomized-helm`{fn-custom-plugin}.

== Deploy Kitchensink app with ArgoCD + Kustomize + Helm

Now we want to deploy a JBoss EAP application using the ``helm`` templates _kustomized_ for dev and test environments.

Check the deployment status in both Argo and OpenShift.

**Argo**

Open the following link to see the new Application objects you just created through the ApplicationSet in ArgoCD UI.

To see the progress of deployment you should go to namespace `helm-{username}` in the OpenShift web console or just copy the following link.

[#benefits]
== Benefits of the GitOps/ArgoCD model

* It provides an infrastructure base as code for application deployment.
* It is based on Git, so everything we know about git is reused.
* Allows deployment in multiple clusters in a simple way.
* Includes the concept of a generator that simplifies complex deployments: multiple departments, business units, etc.
* Not only deploys, but also fixes (un)voluntary modifications in the deployment environments.

*Well, it's time to set up webhooks to automate pipelines run.*
