In order to run this guide *you need to have access to one OpenShift cluster and be cluster admin on it*. For instance using https://try.openshift.com[try.openshift.com], or can use any existing OpenShift4 cluster. Once you have your cluster, you can download the latest OpenShift client `oc` from https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/[here] and add it to your path.

You can check the OpenShift version using:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc version	
----	

The output should show oc version {oc-version}+:	

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
Client Version: {oc-version}
...
----	

Then log in executing `oc login`.
