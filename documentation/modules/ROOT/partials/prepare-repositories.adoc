Everything we do in this section requires that you have fulfilled the xref:01-setup.adoc#prerequisite[prerequisites] section and you're logged in your OpenShift cluster.

So if not already logged in, please do it now.

[CAUTION]
====
If you're using the `web-terminal` or `DevSpaces, you don't need to log in, you're already logged in, try this command `oc whoami` and check that the response is: {username}.

If you receive this error:

[.console-output]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
error: x509: “kube-apiserver-lb-signer” certificate is not trusted
----

Then add this flag to the `oc login` command: `--insecure-skip-tls-verify=true`

oc login -u {username} -p {password} --server=https://api.{api-domain}

[#git-repositories]
== Git Repositories

As explained before you will deploy the same application in different ways, using different tools. You will need to make some changes so the first thing you will do is migrate the code and also the configuration to your Gitea account that has been provisioned as part of the set up of the lab. 

[NOTE]
====
This is necessary because:

- webhooks need to be created and obviously you need permissions on them
- you want to make changes to the code and promote those changes across environments
====

These are the repositories you will migrate:

- *Configuration Repo:* https://github.com/atarazana/kitchensink-conf.git
- *Code Repo:* https://github.com/atarazana/kitchensink.git

[#explore-gitea-console]
== Explore Gitea Console

Before we continue with the migration of the git repositories of our application open the console and check that your credentials are valid and all looks good. 

Copy the next url and open it in a new tab, please use these credentials:

- *USERNAME:* {username}
- *PASSWORD:* {static-password}

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://repository-gitea-system.apps.%BASE_SUBDOMAIN%/user/login
----

You should see something like this. Please enter your credentials and hit the green button.

[#create-git-pat]
== Create Git PAT

Let's create a *Personal Access Token* (PAT) in Gitea for user *{username}*.

include::partial$gitea-create-pat.adoc[]

[#migrate-repositories]
== Migrate Repositories

Now that user *{username}* has been created let's migrate our repositories into Gitea.

include::partial$gitea-migrate-repos.adoc[]

After successfully migrating all the repos you should see this in the Gitea console.

CAUTION: Don't forget to refresh your browser.
