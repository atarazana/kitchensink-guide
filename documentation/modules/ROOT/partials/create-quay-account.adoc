Ok, we have our bot account, now we need to create empty repositories for our gramola microservices. Click on *Create New Repository* and follow instructions to create `gramola-events` repository.

image::create-quay-account-12.png[SIGN IN]

Let's name our new repository as *gramola-events*, make it *public* and *empty*.

image::create-quay-account-13.png[SIGN IN]

Please do the same, this time with this name: *gramola-gateway*.

image::create-quay-account-14.png[SIGN IN]

Now that we have created our empty image repositories we have to give permissions on them to the bot account. Please navigate to *Account Settings*.

image::create-quay-account-15.png[SIGN IN]

Then go to the robot accounts area, click on robot icon on the left. You should see something like this. To give permissions on our repositories click on the *"No repositories"* link.

image::create-quay-account-16.png[SIGN IN]

Give *WRITE* permissions to *gramola-events* and *gramola-gateway* repositories and click on *Update permissions*.
