= Upgrade JBoss EAP Version
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Since you started this guide you've been deploying Kitchensink on JBoss EAP 7.2, in different ways and namespaces, always using S2I to build the image starting from the source code of the Jakarta EE application.

One of the reasons we think S2I is awesome is that this framework should help you whenever you upgrade JBoss itself. The idea is that because you're using S2I extensions mechanism which rely on JBoss scripts of S2I helper scripts, you don't care about the underneath `standalone.xml` file... *almost*. In this lab you will upgrade JBoss from 7.2 to 7.4, let's deal with this *almost*.

[#whats-different]
== What's Different

The most prominent thing you will have to deal with is the version of the builder image itself which changes from 7.2 to 7.4! But not only that, in fact there are a number of things different in 7.4 with regards to 7.2 but in this lab we only need to care about one; the PostgreSQL driver definition which is missing in 7.4.

TIP: You should always consult the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.4/html/7.4.0_release_notes/index[release notes^] for a deeper understanding of changes between versions.

This means that you have to make a change in your `extension/install.sh` script in order to install the needed driver. You will do this later, but before you do.

*Let's start upgrading the builder image from 7.2 to 7.4 BUT only helm-kustomize-dev and helm-kustomize-test for simplicity*. Fixing the other deployments could be a nice job to be done once you finish this lab.

[NOTE]

You will have to make these changes in the corresponding git repos. To do so, please use these credentials:

[#upgrade-builder-image-version]
== Upgrade Builder Image Version

There is one location where we have to upgrade the builder image:

#=> kitchensink-conf/*cicd*/values.yaml#

The following link will take you to file `kitchensink-conf/cicd/values.yaml` where you have to do the following change.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink-conf/_edit/main/cicd/values.yaml#L21
----

Once there, you have to change this:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kitchensinkBuilderImage: jboss-eap72-openshift:1.2
----

With this

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kitchensinkBuilderImage: jboss-eap74-openjdk8-openshift:7.4.0
----

Once you have made the changes scroll down and click on `Commit Changes`.

[#refresh-applications-in-argocd]
== Refresh Applications in ArgoCD

Now let's force the refresh of all our applications at once before we make the last change which will trigger the CI pipeline. To do that you have to go to Argo CD and click on `REFRESH APPS` then click on `ALL` as in the next picture.

image::argocd-refresh-all-apps.png[Apps]

Use this link to open Argo CD and see all applications then proceed as explained.

TIP: The following link has a query parameter `search` which will show only the applications of *{username}*.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{argocd-server}/applications?search={username}
----

[#update-install-script]
== Update `install.sh`

Please copy and paste the following link and open it in a browser. It will take you to file `kitchensink/extensions/install.sh` where you have to uncomment the line where the script configures the PostgreSQL driver.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink/_edit/main/extensions/install.sh#L12
----

Once there, you have to change this:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
# configure_drivers ${injected_dir}/driver-postgresql.env
----

With this (or just uncomment the line):

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
configure_drivers ${injected_dir}/driver-postgresql.env
----

Once you have made the changes scroll down and click on `Commit Changes`.

[#what-did-just-happen]
== What Did Just Happen?

Remember, you have committed and push a change in the *CODE* of *kitchensink*, because `install.sh` is *CODE* only that is _code_ to adapt the image to your needs, but *CODE*!

As with all changes to code there is a webhook that will trigger the CI pipeline and also remember that the last action in that pipeline generates a Pull Request, it doesn't deploy the new image yet!

image::ci-pl-run.png[CI PL Run]

You can follow the progress through the following link and clicking on the Pipeline Run:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{openshift-console-host}/dev-pipelines/ns/cicd-tekton-{username}
----

[#final-tests]
== Final Tests

You have made changes in install.sh which should have trigger the CI pipeline you tested before. 

Let's check the version of JBoss before approving the *Pull Request* in *kitchensink-conf*.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
oc logs deployment/kitchensink -n helm-kustomize-dev-{username} | grep -e "JBoss EAP 7"
----

You should expect something like:

[.console-output]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
17:51:03,635 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (MSC service thread 1-1) WFLYSRV0049: JBoss EAP 7.2.9.GA (WildFly Core 6.0.30.Final-redhat-00001) starting

----

Now you have to do the same, you know, go to *kitchensink-conf*, look for new *Pull Requests*, approve it and wait until the new image has been deployed in *dev*.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink-conf/pulls
----

Click on the `Create merge commit` button:

image::gitea-pr-approve-1.png[Gitea Approve PR]

Before clicking the `Create` button, check the box to delete the branch after merging:

image::gitea-pr-approve-2.png[Gitea Approve PR]

Once the new image has been rolled out, you could open the link to the UI, as you have done before... and then check in the logs if the new version is 7.4.*. You can do it with the next command.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
oc logs deployment/kitchensink -n helm-kustomize-dev-{username} | grep -e "JBoss EAP 7"

----

At this point you can check that the status of the Pipelines is as follows (or wait until you reach that state before continuing):

image::cicd-pl-result.png[CI/CD Pipelines Status]

The last task of the CD Pipeline generated a new PR in the *kitchensink-conf*. 

image::cicd-pl-cd-tasks.png[CD Pipeline Tasks]

Then do the same with the new *Pull Request* and wait until the new image has been deployed in *test*.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]

POD_NAME=$(oc get pod -n helm-kustomize-test-{username} --field-selector=status.phase==Running -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

[#recap]
== Recap

Good job! You started manually deploying a JBoss EAP application using S2I and ended up deploying it in multiple environments using GitOps to finally upgrade JBoss EAP from 7.2 to 7.4. That was quite a trip!

We hope you have enjoyed it and remember you can access all the code and conf here:
