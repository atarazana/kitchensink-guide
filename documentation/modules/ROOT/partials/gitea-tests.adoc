Let's have a look to the Gitea deployment object.

[WARNING]
====
This command only works as expected once the Deployment object has been created by the operator, be patient and try again if you get.

[source,sh]
----
Error from server (NotFound): deployments.apps "repository" not found
----
====

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc rollout status deploy/repository -n {gitea-namespace}
----

This is the normal state after being successfully rolled out.

[.console-output]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
deployment "repository" successfully rolled out
oc get deployment/repository -n {gitea-namespace}
NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
repository   1/1     1            1           32m
----

Once Gitea has been rolled out, run this little smoke test.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -k -I https://{gitea-host}/
----

NOTE: You should get something like this. If you don't, be patient and run this command in 2 mins or so.
