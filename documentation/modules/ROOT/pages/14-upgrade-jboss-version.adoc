= Upgrade JBoss EAP Version
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Since you started this guide you've been deploying Kitchensink on JBoss EAP 7.2, in different ways and namespaces, always using S2I to build the image starting from the source code of the Jakarta EE application.

One of the reasons we think S2I is awesome is that this framework should help you whenever you upgrade JBoss itself. The idea is that because you're using S2I extensions mechanism which rely on JBoss scripts of S2I helper scripts, you don't care about the underneath `standalone.xml` file... *almost*. In this lab you will upgrade JBoss from 7.2 to 7.4, let's deal with this *almost*.

[#whats-different]
== What's Different

Well there are a number of things different in 7.4 with regards to 7.2 but we only care about one for this lab. The PostgreSQL driver definition is missing.

TIP: You should always consult the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.4/html/7.4.0_release_notes/index[release notes] for a deeper understanding of changes between versions.

This means that you have to make a change in your `extension/install.sh` script in order to install the needed driver. You will do this later, but before you do.

*Let's upgrade the builder image from 7.2 to 7.4*.

[#upgrade-builder-image-version]
== Upgrade Builder Image Version

There are some locations where we have to upgrade the builder image:

* kitchensink-conf/*basic*/base/kitchensink-bc.yaml
* kitchensink-conf/*advanced*/helm_base/values.yaml
* kitchensink-conf/*cicd*/values.yaml

#=> kitchensink-conf/*basic*/base/kitchensink-bc.yaml#

Please copy and paste the following link and open it in a browser. It will take you to file `kitchensink-conf/basic/base/kitchensink-bc.yaml` where you have to do the following change.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink-conf/_edit/main/basic/base/kitchensink-bc.yaml#L27
----

Once there, you have to change this:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
name: 'jboss-eap72-openshift:1.2'
----

With this

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]

Once you have made the changes scroll down and click on `Commit Changes`.

#=> kitchensink-conf/*advanced*/helm_base/values.yaml#

Next link will take you to file `kitchensink-conf/advanced/helm_base/values.yaml` where you have to do the following change.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink-conf/_edit/main/advanced/helm_base/values.yaml#L6

Finally, the following link will take you to file `kitchensink-conf/cicd/values.yaml` where you have to do the following change.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink-conf/_edit/main/cicd/values.yaml#L21

Once you have made the changes scroll down and click on `Commit Changes`.

[#update-install-script]
== Update `install.sh`

Please copy and paste the following link and open it in a browser. It will take you to file `kitchensink/extensions/install.sh` where you have to uncomment the line where the script configures the PostgreSQL driver. As usual, in case you forgot, use this credentials to log in.

- *Username:* {username}
- *Password:* {static-password}

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink/_edit/main/extensions/install.sh#L12

Once there, you have to change this:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
# configure_drivers ${injected_dir}/driver-postgresql.env
----

With this

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]

Once you have made the changes scroll down and click on `Commit Changes`.

[#refresh-applications-in-argocd]
== Refresh Applications in ArgoCD

Now let's force the refresh of all our applications at once before we make the last change which will trigger the CI pipeline. To do that you have to go to Argo CD and click on `REFRESH APPS` then click on `ALL` as in the next picture.

image::argocd-refresh-all-apps.png[Apps]

Use this link to open Argo CD and see all applications then proceed as explained.

TIP: The following link has a query parameter `search` which will show only the applications of *{username}*.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]

https://{argocd-server}/applications?search={username}

[#rebuild-images]
== Rebuild Images

Rebuild all images expect for the ones in projects:

* helm-kustomize-dev-{username}
* helm-kustomize-test-{username}.

*Why?* Because for those projects the mechanism to update the images is base on the pipeline you already know.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
PROJECT_BASE_LIST="argo appset-a appset-b kustomize-dev kustomize-test helm helm-kustomize-dev helm-kustomize-test s2i"
for base in ${PROJECT_BASE_LIST};
do
  PROJECT_NAME=${base}-{username}
  oc start-build bc/kitchensink -n ${PROJECT_NAME}
done
----

[#final-tests]
== Final Tests

You have made changes in install.sh which should have trigger the CI pipeline you tested before. 

Let's check the version of JBoss before approving the *Pull Request* in *kitchensink-conf*.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
oc logs deployment/kitchensink -n helm-kustomize-dev-{username} | grep -e "JBoss EAP 7"
----

You should expect something like:

[.console-output]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----

----

Now you have to do the same, you know, go to *kitchensink-conf*, look for new *Pull Requests*, approve it and wait until the new image has been deployed in *dev*.

Once the new image has been rolled out, you could open the link to the UI, as you have done before... and then check in the logs if the new version is 7.4.*. You can do it with the next command.

Then do the same with the new *Pull Request* and wait until the new image has been deployed in *test*.
