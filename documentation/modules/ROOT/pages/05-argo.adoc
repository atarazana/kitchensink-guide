= Deploy JBoss EAP Application with ArgoCD

[#overview]
== Simplification, git-based automation

We have deployed Kitchensink manually using *S2I*, but ...

* How repeatable is this procedure? 
* Auditable? 
* Simple at first, but what about in the long run?

*No worries GitOps to the rescue !!!*

.What is GitOps ?
image::gitops.png[] 

GitOps provides infrastructure as code by using git repositories as the only source of truth that defines de desired cluster state, but GitOps is just an idea, a concept. So in order to use this idea you need an implementation. Red Hat contributes heavily on an community project called link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[Argo CD].

Argo CD can extract the cluster state in a number of ways, directly as files from a folder or by using a plugin.

[#git-repositories-involved]
== Git Repositories Involved

If you remember at the beginning of this guide you migrated a couple of repositories, one was for code, *kitchensink*, the other was for configuration, *kitchensink-conf*.

In this lab you will experience different ways of deploying the application you already know *Kitchesink* in increasing complexity. We have structure the descriptors in *kitchesink-conf* so that these different ways of deployment using Argo CD and live in the same repository.

There are four main directories, namely:

* *basic/base:* here you can find plain yaml descriptors
+
=> In this case #*No plugin* is needed#
* *kustomized/**: here you will find two subdirectories (*_dev and test_*) which are *_overlays or environments_* which relies in a kustomization.yaml file at *basic*
+
=> For this case you will rely on the #*kustomize* plugin#
* *advanced/helm_base:* at this location you can find a helm chart
+
=> here, the #*helm* plugin is needed#
* *advanced/overlays/*:* as in kustomize/* here you will find *_dev and test overlays_* but this time overlays look for resources in *advanced/helm_base* and, as already explained, those resources will be in the shape of a helm chart.
+
=> This case is special, it relies both on helm and kustomized so a #*custom plugin* will be needed#

[#application-keystone-of-argocd]
== `Application`: Keystone of Argo CD

The ``Application`` CRD is the Kubernetes resource object representing a deployed application instance in an environment.

[#fix-buildconfigs-repo-url]
== Fix BuildConfigs Repo URL

As we have explained xref:04-s2i.adoc#overview[before] in this lab `BuildConfig` objects are in charge of cloning a code repository, compile the code and build a container image with that. Well, in this lab, this means that because you migrated the repo those `BuildConfigs` point to the original repo.

*Let's fix that!*

Please copy and paste the following link and open it in a browser. It will take you to file `basic/base/kitchensink-bc.yaml` where you have to change the git url to match the one of the previously migrated repository of code. Use this credentials to log in.

- *Username:* {username}
- *Password:* {static-password}

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink-conf/_edit/main/basic/base/kitchensink-bc.yaml#L40
----

Once there, you have to change this:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
  source:
    type: Git
    git:
      uri: 'https://github.com/atarazana/kitchensink'
      ref: main
----

With this

  source:
    type: Git
    git:

      ref: main

Once you have made the changes scroll down and click on `Commit Changes`.

[#deploy]
== Deploy Kitchensink app with ArgoCD

The first one from a folder containing some descriptors that we have obtained from the ``JBoss EAP 7.2`` template.

Now, you have to run the next command that created the ``ApplicationSet`` object.

Click on the `LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT` button and use the credentials you've used before:

[INFO]
====
If credentials are required use these:

- *USERNAME:* {username}
- *PASSWORD:* {password}

After logging in successfully and agreed to `Allow selected permissions` you will land in the `Applications` area and see the application you've just created.

To see the progress of deployment you should go to namespace `argo-{username}` in the OpenShift web console or just copy the following link.
