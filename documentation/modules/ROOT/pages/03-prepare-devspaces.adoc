= Prepare DevSpaces
include::_attributes.adoc[]

This chapter only applies if you choose DevSpaces as the IDE to use throughout this guide.

[CAUTION]
====
Red Hat Dev Spaces workspaces are by definition already logged in, this means that if you run `oc whoami` in a terminal window you will get `{username}`.

But if for whatever reason the security token expires then running the same command would give us something like:

[.console-output]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc whoami
system:serviceaccount:{username}-devspaces:workspace2e2d939ada0d4cec-sa
----

Should this happened to you, please restart the workspace, the token will be there once it is up and running.
====

[#create-workspace]
== Create Workspace

NOTE: If you're running the guide in a laptop, you don't need to do this.

Please copy and paste the following link and open it in a browser. It will take you to a Red Hat DevSpaces deployment in the OpenShift cluster you're interacting with in this lab. Use this credentials to log in and click on `Allow selected permissions`.

- *Username:* {username}
- *Password:* {password}

[.console-input]
[source,url, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{devspaces-server}/#/https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink/raw/main/devfile.yaml
----

After some seconds you will see that the devfile has been loaded and that your workspace is been created.

After a minute or two you'll have the workspaces prepared and you'll be prompted to answer this question: `Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?`. Click on `Yes, I trust the authors...`.
