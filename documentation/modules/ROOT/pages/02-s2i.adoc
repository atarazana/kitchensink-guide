= Deploy JBoss EAP Application with S2I
include::_attributes.adoc[]

[#overview]
== Overview

https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[Source-to-Image (S2I)] is a framework that makes it easy to write images that take application source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled application as output.

The main advantage of using S2I for building reproducible container images is the ease of use for developers.

[#getting-started]
== Let's get started

Everything we do in this section requires that you have fulfilled the xref:01-setup.adoc#prerequisite[prerequisites] section and you're logged in your OpenShift cluster.

[WARNING]
====
Log in *as normal user*, [.underline]#not as a cluster admin#.
====

So if not already logged in, please do it now.

[CAUTION]
====
If you're using `DevSpaces` or the `web-terminal`, you don't need to log in, you're already logged in, try this command `oc whoami` and check that the response is: {username}.

[#deploy]
== Deploying a JBOSS EAP 7.2 application manually

Let's deploy the Kitchensink App!

[IMPORTANT]
====
This template deploys our application using a `DeploymentConfig` instead of the kubernetes `Deployment` object, starting in chapter `ArgoCD + Helm` you will see that we've moved from `DeploymentConfig` to `Deployment`.

#TODO#
====

. First of all, create the project that will host the application:
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc new-project s2i-{username}
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Please open the next link to watch the progress of the chapter. 

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{openshift-console-host}/topology/ns/s2i-{username}?view=graph
----
====
+
. Deploy the PostgreSQL database for the kitchensink app:
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc new-app --name=kitchensink-db \
 -e POSTGRESQL_USER=luke \
 -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=secret \
 -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=kitchensink centos/postgresql-10-centos7 \
 --as-deployment-config=false

oc label deployment/kitchensink-db app.kubernetes.io/part-of=kitchensink-app --overwrite=true && \
oc label deployment/kitchensink-db app.openshift.io/runtime=postgresql --overwrite=true
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The ``oc label`` commands adds decoration to our deployment (used for the #Topology view#):

- ``app.openshift.io/runtime``: Icon displayed in the node
- ``app.kubernetes.io/part-of``: App grouping
====
+
. Deploy the kitchensink app:
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc new-app --template=eap72-basic-s2i \
-p APPLICATION_NAME=kitchensink \
-p MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND="-Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.jbossorg" \
-p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL="https://{gitea-host}/{username}/kitchensink" \
-p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF=main \
-p CONTEXT_DIR=.
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In order to deploy the Kitchensink app, we use a template, ``eap72-basic-s2i``.

A template describes a set of objects that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects for creation by OpenShift Container Platform. A template can be processed to create anything you have permission to create within a project, for example services, build configurations, and deployment configurations. A template can also define a set of labels to apply to every object defined in the template.

You can create a list of objects from a template using the CLI or, if a template has been uploaded to your project or the global template library, using the web console.
====
+
. Adjust the context of the application and add _decoration_ (labels and annotation):
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc set env dc/kitchensink DB_HOST=kitchensink-db DB_PORT=5432 DB_NAME=kitchensink DB_USERNAME=luke DB_PASSWORD=secret && \
oc set probe dc/kitchensink --readiness --initial-delay-seconds=90 --failure-threshold=5 && \
oc set probe dc/kitchensink --liveness --initial-delay-seconds=90 --failure-threshold=5

oc label dc/kitchensink app.kubernetes.io/part-of=kitchensink-app --overwrite=true && \
oc label dc/kitchensink app.openshift.io/runtime=jboss --overwrite=true

oc annotate dc/kitchensink \
 app.openshift.io/connects-to='[{"apiVersion":"apps/v1","kind":"Deployment","name":"kitchensink-db"}]' \
 --overwrite=true
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The ``app.openshift.io/connects-to`` annotation is used to connect the nodes.

image::s2i-01.png[Build Config link]

Eventually you will see a trace like this => `>>>>>>> Running install.sh <<<<<<`. This is a sign that the S2I building process has detected our script to prepare the image as desired.

image::s2i-02.png[Build Log]

#Explain this better and according to the explanations given before in this chapter#

After the building process has finished the image is pushed and the `DeploymentConfig` object is updated accordingly to use the new image. If you go the `Topology` view you should see this.

image::s2i-04.png[Deployed]

Time to check if our application works as expected. Please click on the route icon.

You should see something like this.

[#redeploy]
== Redeploying a JBOSS EAP application

[CAUTION]
====
You have to wait until the application has been deployed, in the previous item, in order to redeploy it!


====

Let's explore a quick way to test _minor_ changes in our application. In this case you will package your JBoss EAP application locally and later you will use ``oc cp`` to copy the WAR file directly to the deployment folder of JBoss EAP already running in OCP.

[CAUTION]
====
Use this way of deployment only in a #development environment#, #*NEVER* in productive environments#.
====

Let's make a change in our application, open file `src/main/webapp/index.xhtml` and go to line 27 approx. and make a change. For instance change this:

[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
<div>
    <p>You have successfully deployed the JBoss Application in OpenShift</p>
</div>
----

With:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
<div>
    <p>You have successfully deployed the JBoss Application in OpenShift !!!</p>
</div
----

Then please, run these commands:

[NOTE]
====
`oc cp` command doesn't show a progress bar and usually is quite fast, if there are no errors no messages will be surfaced, just proceed with the tests.
====

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc project s2i-{username}

POD_NAME=$(oc get pod -l application=kitchensink -o json | jq -r .items[0].metadata.name)
echo "POD_NAME=${POD_NAME}"

mvn package -Popenshift

oc cp ./target/ROOT.war ${POD_NAME}:/deployments/ROOT.war
----

Open this link to check if the change is already applied.

[CAUTION]
====
Take into account that for a short period of time the app is being replaced and you could get a 404 error if you're quick enough.
